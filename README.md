Adobe Home Automation Website Project

Notes:
There were a couple assumptions made accoriding to the language of the requirements document. 
One, there is no real server component which is being interacted with, therefore, the server interactions are
faked using the Server.js file. Second, I used bootstrap to add a little life to the webpage 
to keep it from looking so bland.
